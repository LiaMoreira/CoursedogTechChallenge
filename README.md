// If I add access to the dev branch to test I would check and wait for each api request that's needed to be made

// There's a lot of sync problems, sometimes cypress finds the events, sometimes don't. 

// It said in the tak description that model un has 3 events but it has found 4 ( the QA task counts as an event)

//When I click on a date the filter is cleared, don't know if this is a bug but it's not very user friendly in my humble opion

//If I select a specific date and then I filter for the organization the result are all next events, shouldn't be just events for that day from that organization?

//Featured events, I think, is giving featured events from today's day forward so that may be why it's not finding any even when I select the date before ( don't know if it's a bug or not)
